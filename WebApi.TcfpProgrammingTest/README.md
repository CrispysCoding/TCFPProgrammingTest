# TCFP Programming Test (Web API, .NET 6)

## About

This project will help us evaluate how much you know about REST API, .NET 6 and C#. It consists of a simple .NET 6 Minium API with in memory data. 
Here at the Texas Commission of Fire Protection we run a similar Web API that communicates with a few frontends.

One of the most important things we do at the Texas Commission of Fire Protection is to track how firefighters
get injured at the line of duty. In order to make their jobs safer, we look at this data to see how we
can prevent them from happening.

## Injury Reports

The code in this repository consists of a backend that can be used to create, read, update and delete Injury Reports.

There are two lists: one with departments and one with injury reports. The Web API contains several routes that either displays or manipulates them.

Your job is to add code to each route that does what we need them to do. Look for `TODO` comments as they have information on what they must be doing.

Good luck!

## Get Started

This project was created with Visual Studio 2022 in mind. The Community version is free.

Once you have it installed, open this project with it and you should be good to go.

## Running the project

When you run this project with Visual Studio, a browser window will open with a page that will allow you to interact and make requests to it. 
That's how we are going to test it to see if we you got it right. Hot Reload is also built in to improve your DX.

## Evaluation

The first criteria for evaluation will be if the application does what its supposed to do without any bugs: create, read, update, delete
injury reports.

The second criteria will be code quality.
