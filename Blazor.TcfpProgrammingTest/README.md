# TFCP Programming Test (Blazor WebAssembly)

# About 

This project consists of a Blazor WebASsembly application that will help us evaluate your skills in
creating user interfaces with it and the C# programming language.

One of the most important things we do at the Texas Commission of Fire Protection is to track how firefighters
get injured at the line of duty. In order to make their jobs safer, we look at this data to see how we
can prevent them from happening.

## Injury Reports

The code in this repository contains a Blazor WebAssembly application that manipulates injury report data: create, read, update, delete them.

The entire application lives in `Pages/Index.razor`. There is a global `StateContainer` that holds department and injury report data
that you will use in this project.

Your job is to go through the `Pages/Index.razor`, read the comments and wherever you see `TODO`, do what we are asking. We would also like
to see you split certain parts of the UI into components that can be reusable.

Good luck!

## Get Started

This project was created with Visual Studio 2022 in mind. The Community version is free.

Once you have it installed, open this project with it and you should be good to go.

## Running the project

When you run the project in Visual Studio 2022, a new browser window will open with the application for you to use it. 
Hot Reload is built in to improve your DX.

## Evaluation

The first criteria for evaluation will be if the application does what its supposed to do without any bugs: create, read, update, delete
injury reports.

The second criteria will be both code quality and UI/UX.
